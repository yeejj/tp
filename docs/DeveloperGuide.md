## Design & Implementation

### Architecture

The following architecture diagram provides a high-level view of the Transaction Manager system:

![Architecture Overview](./diagrams/ArchitectureOverview.png)

The Transaction Manager follows a layered architecture with the following main components:

1. **Main**: The entry point that initializes all components and starts the application loop.
2. **Parser**: Handles user input parsing, command validation, and delegates operations to the TransactionsList.
3. **TransactionsList**: Manages the collection of Transaction objects and provides CRUD operations.
4. **Transaction**: Represents individual financial transactions with validation and data integrity.
5. **Validators**: Utility classes (CurrencyValidator, TransactionType) that enforce business rules.

The components interact as follows:
- `Duke` creates and initializes `Parser` and `TransactionsList`.
- `Parser` processes user commands and calls methods on `TransactionsList`.
- `TransactionsList` manages `Transaction` objects and uses validators for data integrity.
- `Transaction` objects encapsulate individual transaction data and validation logic.


### Design Considerations

**Transaction Storage**: Transactions are stored in an ArrayList for efficient random access and iteration. This design choice supports the application's requirement for fast listing and editing operations.

**Command Parsing**: The Parser uses simple string splitting and HashMap storage for command arguments, providing flexibility for future command extensions without complex parsing logic.

**Validation Separation**: Validation logic is separated into dedicated classes (CurrencyValidator, TransactionType) to follow the Single Responsibility Principle and enable easy testing and modification.

### Component-Level Design

#### Parser Component
The Parser component is responsible for:
- Reading user input from the console
- Parsing command strings into actionable operations
- Validating command syntax and arguments
- Delegating operations to the TransactionsList component
- Providing user feedback and error messages


#### Transaction Management Component
The TransactionsList component provides:
- Storage and management of Transaction objects using ArrayList
- Auto-incremented ID generation
- CRUD operations (add, list, edit, delete, clear)
- Data integrity maintenance
- Logging for debugging and monitoring

#### Model Components
The Transaction, TransactionType, and CurrencyValidator classes form the data model:
- **Transaction**: Represents a financial transaction with date, description, amount, type, and currency
- **TransactionType**: Validates and stores transaction type (debit/credit)
- **CurrencyValidator**: Validates currency codes against an approved list


**Key Relationships**:
- `Duke` aggregates `Parser` and `TransactionsList`
- `Parser` uses `TransactionsList` for operations
- `TransactionsList` contains multiple `Transaction` objects
- `Transaction` uses `TransactionType` and `CurrencyValidator`
- All components use Java's built-in collections and utilities


## Implementation Details

### Transaction Flow
Implementer: Pran

The transaction flow manages the lifecycle of user financial records from user input down to persistent storage.

**CRUD Operations**
*   **Create (Add):** The `Parser` extracts transaction arguments (date, description, amount, type, currency) and instantiates a `Transaction` object. The `TransactionsList` adds this object to its in-memory list and immediately triggers a save.
![Class Diagram](./diagrams/addtransactionflow.png)
*   **Read (List):** `TransactionsList` retrieves the list of transactions, sorts them chronologically by date, and displays them. It optionally collaborates with the `CurrencyConverter` to display amounts in a user-specified target currency without mutating the underlying data.
![Class Diagram](./diagrams/listtransactionflow.png)
*   **Update (Edit):** Users can modify specific fields of an existing transaction using its auto-incremented ID. `TransactionsList` retrieves the target transaction and updates only the provided fields.

*   **Delete/Clear:** Individual transactions are removed by ID, or the entire list is cleared via `TransactionsList`. Both operations immediately trigger a save to storage.

**Transaction Data Model**
*   The `Transaction` class acts as the core entity. It contains an auto-incrementing integer ID, a `LocalDate` (enforced as DD/MM/YYYY), a description, a `double` amount, a `TransactionType` object, and a `String` currency.
*   Validation is strictly enforced upon instantiation:
    *   `TransactionType` restricts types to strictly "debit" or "credit".
    *   `CurrencyValidator` restricts currencies to an approved list ("SGD", "USD", "EUR").

---

### Design Decisions
*   **Fail-Fast Validation in Domain Entities:** Validation logic (e.g., checking for empty descriptions, valid date formats, valid currencies) is strictly enforced directly inside the `Transaction` constructor, `TransactionType`, and `CurrencyValidator`. 
    *   *Rationale:* This ensures that a `Transaction` object can never exist in an invalid state in memory. If bad data is passed, it fails immediately before being added to the list.
*   **Encapsulated Validation:** Validation logic for specific fields is separated into utility/wrapper classes (`TransactionType` and `CurrencyValidator`) rather than bloating the `Transaction` class itself.
*   **Wrapper Classes for Constrained Values:** Instead of keeping the transaction type as a raw string, it is wrapped in a `TransactionType` struct-like class.
    *   *Rationale:* It centralizes the string-matching logic (allowing case-insensitive checks for "debit" or "credit") and prevents typos from polluting the data model.
---

### Alternatives Considered
**1. Input Parsing: Regex Flag Mapping vs. Fixed Position Arguments**
*   **Alternative:** Require users to enter data in a strict order separated by a delimiter (e.g., `add 18/03/2026 | Office supplies | 45.50 | debit | SGD`).
*   **Pros:** Much simpler to implement using a basic `String.split("\\|")`.
*   **Cons:** Highly error-prone for the user. If they forget the order or miss a delimiter, the application will parse the wrong fields.
*   **Decision:** The regex-based flag map (using `-desc`, etc.) was chosen to prioritize a flexible, forgiving user experience over implementation simplicity.

**2. Transaction Identifiers: Auto-incrementing Integer vs UUID**
*   **Alternative:** Assign a randomly generated UUID to each transaction instead of an auto-incrementing integer.
*   **Pros:** Eliminates the need to track the `nextId` state across application restarts and prevents ID collisions when merging files.
*   **Cons:** UUIDs are long, clunky, and highly inconvenient for users to type in a CLI environment when running `edit` or `delete` commands.
*   **Decision:** Auto-incrementing integers were selected to provide a user-friendly, concise CLI experience.
