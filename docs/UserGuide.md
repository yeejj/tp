## Understanding Double-Entry Accounting

### What is Double-Entry Bookkeeping?
Double-entry bookkeeping is an accounting method where every financial transaction affects at least two accounts. For every debit entry, there must be a corresponding credit entry of equal value. This system ensures that the accounting equation always remains balanced.

### Hierarchical Accounts

Ledger67 supports hierarchical account structures using `:`.

This allows accounts to be organised into categories and subcategories:

- `Assets:Cash`
- `Assets:Bank:DBS`
- `Expenses:Food`

This structure enables more powerful filtering and organisation of financial data.

### Sign Convention
Ledger67 uses a **signed amount model** instead of debit/credit.
* `+` indicates an **increase**
* `-` indicates a **decrease**

#### Recommended Usage
| Account Type                | Increase | Decrease |
| --------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Assets, Expenses            | `+`      | `-`      |
| Liabilities, Equity, Income | `-`      | `+`      |

#### Note
Ledger67 only checks that transactions are **balanced**, and does not enforce sign conventions.
Users are encouraged to follow the recommended usage for consistency.

### Key Concepts for Beginners

#### 1. The Accounting Equation
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

Where:
Equity is affected by Income and Expenses:
Equity = Initial Equity + (Income - Expenses)
```
- **Assets**: What you own (cash, inventory, equipment)
- **Liabilities**: What you owe (loans, accounts payable)
- **Equity**: Your ownership interest in the business
- **Income**: Money received in exchange for labor or the sale of products
- **Expenses**: Cost of Operation

#### 2. How Transactions Work in Ledger67
In Ledger67, each transaction in Ledger67 consists of multiple postings that together form a complete double-entry record.

The system ensures that all postings within a transaction are balanced, meaning the total debits equal total credits.

Each transaction is a collection of `Postings`
Postings are records of money going into each category (Assets, Liabilities, Equity, etc)
These categories can have subcategories such as Assets:Cash or Liabilities:Loans
These `Postings` must balance each other out.

### Example: Recording a Sale
When you make a sale for $100 cash:
- `Assets:Cash` increases by $100
- `Income` increases by $100

The equation is balanced and the transaction is valid. In Ledger67, you would record this as a single transaction, and the system understands the double-entry implications.

## Features

### 1. UI Assist: `uiassist`
Toggles whether the user is using UI Assist in which the program helps the user guide through the input or the user is using the standard tagging system

**Format:** `uiassist -on/-off`
`uiassist -on` toggles the UI Assistance on. The user is now using prompted inputs to fill in the details
`uiassist -off` toggles the UI Assistance off. The user is now using the standard tagging system

### 2. Adding a Transaction: `add`
Adds a new financial transaction to your ledger.

**Format (Manual)**: `add -date DATE -desc DESCRIPTION -p POSTING1 -p POSTING2 -c CURRENCY`

**Parameters**
- `-date`: The date of the transaction (e.g., `DD/MM/YYYY`).
- `-desc`: A brief description of the transaction.
- `-p`: A posting containing an account name and an amount (enclosed in quotes). You must have at least two postings.
- `-c`: The currency code (e.g., SGD, USD, EUR).

**Example**
```
add -date 18/03/2026 -desc "Office supplies" -p "Assets:Cash -45.50" -p "Expenses:OfficeSupplies 45.50" -c SGD
```

**Format (Presets)**: `add -date DATE -preset TYPE AMOUNT -c CURRENCY`


**Parameters**
- `-date`: The date of the transaction (e.g., `DD/MM/YYYY`).
- `-desc`: A brief description of the transaction.
- `-presets`: Presets: DAILYEXPENSE, INCOME, BUYINGSTOCKS
- `-c`: The currency code (e.g., SGD, USD, EUR).

**Notes**
- Account roots are not case-sensitive
- Sub-account names are case-sensitive, this is to preserve acronyms and other valid mixed-cased names. 

**Example**
```
add -date 18/03/2026 -preset DAILYEXPENSE 50.00 -c SGD
```

### 3. Listing and Filtering Transactions: `list`
Displays recorded transactions. You can view all transactions or use filters to narrow down the results by date, account, keyword, or currency.

**Format**: `list [-acc ACCOUNT] [-begin DATE] [-end DATE] [-match REGEX] [-to CURRENCY]`

**Parameters**:
- `-acc ACCOUNT`: Only show transactions containing this account (and only show that specific account's line).
- `-begin DATE`: Show transactions on or after this date (DD/MM/YYYY).
- `-end DATE`: Show transactions on or before this date (DD/MM/YYYY).
- `-match REGEX`: Show transactions where the description matches the given keyword or regular expression.
- `-to CURRENCY`: Display all values converted to a specific currency for viewing purposes.

> **Note on Currency**: When using `-to`, the displayed values are **view-only**. To permanently save these converted values to your ledger, follow up with the `confirm` command.

**Examples**:
*   **View everything**: `list`
*   **View January food expenses**: `list -acc Expenses:Food -begin 01/01/2026 -end 31/01/2026`
*   **Search for any "Lunch" or "Dinner"**: `list -match "(Lunch|Dinner)"`
*   **View all expenses in USD**: `list -acc Expenses -to USD`

#### Example Output
```

ID: 2 | Date: 2026-03-19 | Desc: Salary | [USD]
Assets:Bank:DBS              :    3000.00

ID: 3 | Date: 2026-03-20 | Desc: Transfer | [SGD]
Assets:Cash                  :    -500.00

```

---

#### Combining with Currency View

You can combine filtering with currency display:

```

list -acc Assets -to USD

```

This will:
- Filter transactions under `Assets`
- Display converted values in USD

---

#### Notes
- This is a **view feature** — it does not modify stored data.
- Filtering works based on account hierarchy (not simple text matching).

---

#### View Converted Values of All Listed Transactions: `list -to TARGET_CURRENCY`
Views all existing transactions to a different currency.

**Format**: `list -to TARGET_CURRENCY`

**Parameters**:
- `-to TARGET_CURRENCY`: Target currency code - `SGD`, `USD`, or `EUR`

---

#### Confirming a Single Converted Transaction

After using:

```
convert transaction ID -to TARGET_CURRENCY
```

You can store the converted result using:

```
confirm
```

**Example**:

```
convert transaction 3 -to SGD
confirm
```

**Result**:

* The transaction’s **amount** is updated to the converted value
* The transaction’s **currency** is updated to the target currency
* Changes are saved permanently

### 10. Viewing the Balance Sheet: `balance`

Displays a summary of your financial position based on the accounting equation:
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

```
This command aggregates all transactions and shows totals by account category.

---

#### Basic Format
```
balance
```
#### Example Output
```
===== BALANCE SHEET =====
Scope: ALL ACCOUNTS
Report Currency: ORIGINAL TRANSACTION CURRENCIES

ASSETS
Assets:Cash                          350.00
Assets:Bank:Main                    200.00
Total Assets                        550.00

LIABILITIES
Total Liabilities                     0.00

EQUITY
Equity:Capital                      400.00
Current Period Net Income           150.00
Total Equity                        550.00

CHECK
Total Assets                        550.00
Liabilities + Total Equity          550.00
Equation Status                     PASS
========================================

```

---

#### Including Income and Expenses
Ledger67 automatically incorporates:

- **Income** → increases Equity  
- **Expenses** → decreases Equity  

These are reflected as:
```
Net Income = Income - Expenses
```
This ensures the balance sheet satisfies:
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
```

---
#### Filtering Balance Sheet by Account: `balance -acc`

Allows you to generate a balance sheet for a specific account hierarchy.

#### Format
```

balance -acc ACCOUNT

```

#### Examples
```

balance -acc Assets
balance -acc Assets:Bank

```

#### Behaviour
- Includes only accounts under the specified hierarchy
- Uses the same hierarchical logic as `list -acc`
- May not balance fully (partial view)

#### Example Output
```

Scope: Assets:Bank
Equation Status: FILTERED VIEW (may not balance)

```

---
#### Viewing Balance Sheet in Another Currency: `balance -to`
Displays all values converted into a target currency.

#### Format
```

balance -to TARGET_CURRENCY

```

#### Example
```

balance -to USD

```

#### Behaviour
- Converts all postings into the selected currency
- Uses latest exchange rates
- Does NOT modify stored data

---

#### Combining Filters and Conversion

You can combine both options:

```

balance -acc Assets:Bank -to USD

```

---
#### Exporting Balance Sheet

Each time the `balance` command is run:

- A CSV file is generated at:
```
data/balance-sheet.csv
```

#### File Contents
The CSV includes:
- Account names
- Aggregated balances
- Report currency

#### Notes
- The file is overwritten each time `balance` is executed
- Useful for Excel analysis or reporting
- Export does NOT affect ledger data

---

### Important Notes

- `balance` is a **read-only feature**
- It does NOT modify any transactions
- Currency conversion is **view-only**
- Filtering may result in non-balanced views

---

### 11. Getting Help: `help`
Displays available commands and usage instructions.

**Format**: `help`

**Example**:
```
help
```

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: Ledger67 stores transactions locally in a file. You can transfer your data by copying the data file to another computer.

**Q**: What's the difference between debit and credit in simple terms?

**A**: Think of debit as "what comes in" or "expenses/increases in assets," and credit as "what goes out" or "income/increases in liabilities or equity." In Ledger67, you record transactions based on how they affect your accounts.

**Q**: Can I use Ledger67 for personal finance tracking?

**A**: Absolutely! While based on double-entry principles used in business accounting, Ledger67 works perfectly for personal finance. Record expenses as debits and income as credits to maintain a clear picture of your financial health.

**Q**: What currencies does Ledger67 support?

**A**: Currently, Ledger67 supports SGD (Singapore Dollar), USD (US Dollar), and EUR (Euro). More currencies can be added in future updates.

**Q**: How does Ledger67 handle the double-entry aspect if I only enter one side?

**A**: Ledger67 follows a strict double-entry system.

Every transaction must include at least two postings, and the system ensures that:
- Total debits = total credits

Transactions that do not balance will be rejected.
